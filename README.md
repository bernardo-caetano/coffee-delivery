# Coffee Delivery

## This project is an e-commerce platform for a coffee shop, where it is possible to add coffees to a cart on the home page. Then, on the checkout page, users can input their data and change the quantity of coffees they want. Finally, on the success page, some data is shown to the user, and the order is confirmed.
